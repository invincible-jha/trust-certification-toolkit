# Official Certification Submission

## Current status: self-assessment only

The AumOS Certified badge program currently operates in **self-assessment mode**.
All conformance checks run locally on your own machine and the badge you receive reflects
your own test results, not a third-party audit.

Badges generated by this toolkit always carry the label "Self-Assessed" to make this
distinction clear.

## What self-assessment means

- Conformance checks are run against your implementation by you.
- The toolkit is open source — all check logic is fully auditable at
  [github.com/aumos-ai/trust-certification-toolkit](https://github.com/aumos-ai/trust-certification-toolkit).
- There is no hidden scoring and no criteria beyond what is documented in
  `docs/certification-levels.md`.
- The badge signals to your users that you have taken the time to verify your implementation
  against the published AumOS governance protocol requirements.

## Future: officially audited certification

MuVeraAI Corporation plans to offer an officially audited certification service in a future
commercial offering. Official certification will involve:

- Third-party review of your implementation by a qualified AumOS auditor.
- Execution of an extended conformance suite beyond the open-source checks.
- Issuance of a signed certificate and a distinct "Officially Certified" badge variant.

Official certification will be a commercial service. Pricing and availability will be
announced on [muveraai.com](https://muveraai.com) when the program launches.
