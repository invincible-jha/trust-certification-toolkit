# Contributing to trust-certification-toolkit

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This is a stub — full contribution
guidelines will be published at launch.

## Quick Rules

- Read `FIRE_LINE.md` before writing any code
- All source files must carry the SPDX license header
- Python: type hints on every function signature, Pydantic v2 for validation
- TypeScript: strict mode, no `any`, Zod for runtime validation
- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`
- No automatic trust progression, behavioral scoring, or external communication

See [FIRE_LINE.md](FIRE_LINE.md) for the complete scope boundary.
